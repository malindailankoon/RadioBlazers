Hi all, welcome.

Thank you for everyone who joined today. 

Every batch goes through these sessions once during their time at the department and we tried our best to schedule these in a way to have the minimum impact on your studies, expecting your involvement in return.

Most of you didn't hold your end of the deal. People from our batch had to join in the middle of CV preparations, career fair preparation (work that should be done by you) and their own final year projects(we have a considerably smaller timeline than previous batches). These affect our career(not just one single module).

Success of the SPARK branch depends on how well you do on this project. Your low enthusiasm shows the failure of the branch especially on me as the vice president. Please feel free to contact me to raise any concern you have regarding the process.

I know most of you will ignore this message. Thanks again for reading till the end.
